Your portfolio is often the first impression potential employers or clients have of you. In this guide, we'll explore how to structure your content for maximum impact.

## The Problem with Most Portfolios

Many developer portfolios fall into common traps:

- **Too technical** - Focus on technologies rather than outcomes
- **No context** - Screenshots without explaining the problem solved
- **Outdated** - Projects from years ago with no recent work
- **Generic** - Same template and content as everyone else

## Content Hierarchy That Works

Structure your portfolio with a clear hierarchy:

### 1. Lead with Impact

Start with your most impressive achievement, not your most recent project. Lead with outcomes:

> "Reduced page load times by 60%, resulting in a 25% increase in user engagement"

is better than:

> "Built a React application with Redux and TypeScript"

### 2. Tell Stories, Not Features

For each project, answer these questions:

1. **What was the challenge?** - Set the context
2. **What was your approach?** - Show your thinking
3. **What was the result?** - Prove the impact
4. **What did you learn?** - Demonstrate growth

## Structuring Case Studies

A great case study template:

```markdown
## Project Name

**Role:** Lead Developer  
**Timeline:** 3 months  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js, PostgreSQL, Stripe

### The Challenge
Client needed to process 10,000 daily transactions 
with their legacy system failing under load.

### The Solution
Designed a new architecture with event sourcing 
and implemented progressive rollout...

### The Results
- 99.9% uptime (up from 94%)
- 3x faster transaction processing
- $50K monthly savings in infrastructure
```

## Writing About Side Projects

Side projects demonstrate passion and initiative. For each one, highlight:

- **Why you built it** - What problem were you solving?
- **Interesting challenges** - What made it technically interesting?
- **What you'd do differently** - Shows self-awareness and growth

## The About Page

Your about page should:

1. **Be human** - Share your personality, not just skills
2. **Show values** - What do you care about in your work?
3. **Include a photo** - People connect with faces
4. **Have a clear CTA** - What should visitors do next?

## Keeping Content Fresh

Set a quarterly reminder to:

- [ ] Update project screenshots
- [ ] Add recent work
- [ ] Remove outdated projects
- [ ] Refresh your bio and skills
- [ ] Check for broken links

## Final Thoughts

Your portfolio is a product, and like any product, it should be designed for its users. Think about who you want to attract and craft your content to speak directly to them.

Remember: quality over quantity. Three well-documented projects beat ten half-explained ones every time.
