## Overview

A modern, performant e-commerce platform leveraging the latest Next.js 15 features including Server Components, Server Actions, and the App Router. This project demonstrates best practices for building production-ready applications with excellent SEO and Core Web Vitals scores.

## Key Features

### Server-Side Architecture
- **React Server Components** for optimal performance
- **Server Actions** for mutations without client-side JavaScript
- **Streaming SSR** with Suspense boundaries for instant page loads
- **Partial Prerendering** for hybrid static/dynamic pages

### E-Commerce Functionality
- Product catalog with advanced filtering and search
- Shopping cart with optimistic UI updates
- Secure checkout flow with Stripe integration
- Order management and tracking
- Customer reviews and ratings

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization using `next/image` with priority loading
- Route prefetching for instant navigation
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for product pages
- Edge runtime for global low-latency

## Technical Highlights

### Metadata API for SEO
```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const product = await getProduct(params.id);

  return {
    title: product.name,
    description: product.description,
    openGraph: {
      images: [product.image],
    },
  };
}
```

Following [Next.js metadata best practices](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata), each product page generates dynamic SEO metadata for optimal search visibility.

### Image Optimization
All product images use the Next.js Image component with proper sizing and the `priority` attribute for above-the-fold content, ensuring excellent Core Web Vitals scores.

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript implementation with strict mode enabled, providing compile-time safety and excellent developer experience.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Maintaining cart state across server/client boundary
**Solution**: Implemented using Server Actions with optimistic updates, providing instant feedback while ensuring data consistency.

**Challenge**: SEO for dynamic product pages
**Solution**: Leveraged `generateMetadata` and `generateStaticParams` for optimal crawlability and social sharing.

## Results

- **95+ Lighthouse score** across all metrics
- **Sub-200ms** initial load time on Vercel Edge
- **Zero layout shift** (CLS: 0)
- **Full SEO coverage** with dynamic metadata

## Lessons Learned

Building with Next.js 15's App Router required rethinking traditional React patterns. Server Components dramatically simplified data fetching and improved performance, but required careful consideration of the client/server boundary.

The new Server Actions eliminated the need for API routes in many cases, reducing code complexity and improving type safety across the stack.
