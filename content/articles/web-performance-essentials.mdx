Performance isn't just about speed—it's about user experience, SEO, and ultimately, business success. Google's research shows that 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load.

## The Metrics That Matter

Google's Core Web Vitals have become the standard for measuring user experience:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

Measures loading performance. Aim for LCP under 2.5 seconds. This is when the main content of your page becomes visible.

### First Input Delay (FID)

Measures interactivity. Users should be able to interact with your page within 100ms of trying. Long JavaScript tasks block the main thread and delay this.

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

Measures visual stability. Nothing frustrates users more than clicking a button only to have the page shift and click something else. Keep CLS under 0.1.

## Quick Wins

Here are optimizations that typically provide the biggest impact:

### 1. Optimize Images

Images are usually the heaviest assets on a page:

```jsx
// Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority // For above-the-fold images
  placeholder="blur"
/>
```

### 2. Minimize JavaScript

Every kilobyte of JavaScript has a cost:

- Code split with dynamic imports
- Tree shake unused code
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Use modern, lighter alternatives to heavy libraries

### 3. Leverage Caching

Set appropriate cache headers:

```js
// next.config.js
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/_next/static/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Cache-Control',
          value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

### 4. Use a CDN

Serve static assets from edge locations close to your users. Vercel, Cloudflare, and AWS CloudFront all provide excellent CDN solutions.

## Measuring Performance

You can't improve what you don't measure:

1. **Lighthouse** - Built into Chrome DevTools
2. **WebPageTest** - Detailed waterfall analysis
3. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)** - Track actual user experiences

## The Performance Budget

Set and enforce limits:

- JavaScript bundle: < 200KB (gzipped)
- First contentful paint: < 1.8s
- Time to interactive: < 3.9s

Include performance checks in your CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before they reach production.

## Common Mistakes

Avoid these performance anti-patterns:

- Loading fonts from Google Fonts without preconnect
- Not lazy-loading below-the-fold images
- Blocking rendering with synchronous scripts
- Not compressing assets
- Missing width/height on images (causes layout shift)

## Start Today

Pick one metric to improve this week. Run Lighthouse, identify your biggest bottleneck, and fix it. Small, consistent improvements compound into significant gains.

Performance is a feature. Treat it like one.
